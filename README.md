Python projects from the book *Tiny Python Projects*.

## About

This repository contains Python projects and exercises I completed while working through
the book *Tiny Python Projects* by Ken Youens-Clark. It serves as a learning tracker
and a way to practice Python coding skills through small, practical projects.
